In previous years, Discover hosted a conference featuring a series of unscripted conversations between professors from each of the campuses.

The music reflects my taste, while helping with language learning, but I sense it’s ulterior purpose is identity validation. Choosing music to represent myself and the shop can feel like a performance. To be Korean can feel like a performance. <br><br>Thinking that many customers may associate the music with me being Korean, provides a duality of validation, yet anonymity I had never previously experienced. But every so often other Koreans will come in, firstly identifiable by language, but secondly identifiable by their twitching ears and widened eyes locating the startling sound of a familiar language in a Taiwanese-American business. Having features of a Korean person, their eyes interrogate mine to determine whether there is a shared identity, but their validation would reveal the person beneath this deceptive character. <br><br>Our shared identity is often confirmed by their receipt name from the order kiosk. My existance trembles all the way through the receipt in my hand. While methodically making their drink, with each pour, sitr, and shake, I silently practice the pronunciation of their name. As their drink seals, panic constrains me. <em>What did I just say? How did you just pronounce their name? How could it have sounded so right, but stumbled out of my mouth so wrong? What are they thinking? Did they smirk? Did they chuckle? What do they think? I’m a romanticizing “Koreaboo”?

        "description": "Something special for the occassion. Something comforting for the night. Something warm for the stomach. Food is shared and gifted as an expressive, communicative act of hostpitality, respect, and love. Despite food being a language of care in many cultures, the commidification of food under late-stage capitalism perpuetuates our isolation from each other and our food. How can we value our food without understanding its origins, labor, and lifecycle? How can we share food when it isn’t treated as a basic necessity? <br><br>In the US, <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/facts\">millions of people struggle with poverty, low income and other finiancial burdens</a>, which is inextricably linked to food insecurity. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/americans-waste-food-fruit-vegetables-study\">150,000 tons of food is wasted by Americans each day</a>, the majority of which is wasted by those who can afford healthier diets. As a result, <a href=\"https://drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste\">food waste is also the world’s third largest emmitter of greenhouse gases</a>. The contradictions are quite obvious. Food is increasingly over-consumed, yet inaccessible, while at the same time, we are increasingly isolated from one another, yet need connection. Can we find that connection through food? <br><br>From a small pool of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxjbzdNtRD_FnPZzGtN03suQl_kcH8OGQc26wM-FAMs/edit?usp=sharing\">people we interviewed</a> in Providence, RI, sharing food was a complicated matter. There were many concerns regarding trust, convienence, willingness, and complacency, but from the food sharing experiences people have had, they derived from trusting relationships and communities, and/or prevention of food waste. Inspired by these types of gatherings and exchanges, we created a food sharing platform, <em>Sum</em>, that addresses these rising issues by providing a space to organize a shared meal with family, neighbors, and maybe some new friends. <br><br>Update 4/10/22: <br>While this project furthers our community connection and food consumption awareness, it purpetuates wealth disparities and does not necessarily increase food accessiblity as it is an experience for those with proximity to fresh food, excess time, and secure housing. I believe for  projects such as this one, we should be careful not to overlook and co-opt the work of mututal aid efforts have done in ensuring the survival of their communities, but rather learn from the ways in which they successfully organized movements of solidarity in opposition towards dominate powers.

As a project that was begun in the spring semester of 2020, early within the COVID-19 pandemic, our group noticed a lack of digital tools for critical thinking and wandering thoughts as the world abruptly transitioned from physical to digital spaces. It was particularly apparent that this was also a reflection of our industrial-age education as it is a system that incentivizes efficiency and prescribed thought rather than creativity and curiosity. <br><br>For the duration of this project, we found open-ended, unstructured conversation to be conducive to the creativity and curiosity of thoughts. However, the ability to record, connect, and reflect is essential to even more profound ideas, questions and conversations. In many ways, the simple method of using post-it notes would have achieved our goals, but would not have been as responsive, engaging, and robust as we wanted. With this in mind, we used the analogy of galaxies to create a visualization and collection process which builds complexity and curiosity within one’s thoughts. <br><br>Update 4/7/21: <br>There is always a new note-taking system being made, but it was really cool to find out that <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> was also being created at the same time as our porject in the spring of 2020.

My third attempt was the closest to the conveying the experiences in which my work is grounded in, but I caught myself trying to forcibly wax poetics and meaning into it. I usually stop writing at that realization, but in the end, something else made sense. That a people is embodied within the voice, not the language. <br><br>In my third iteration, I said, “To lose a language means it is something recoverable. But to lose a language means to grieve it as well”. It is a contradiction has defined my understanding of my grief, as language, as Korean, feels intrinsically tied to a people, to an ancestry, to a history, to a sense of collective grief yet resiliency— to family. For me, language can feel like exile, unable to communicate with myself and my people. But at the same time, transnational adoption and I originate from the same painful history of colonization, separation, war, loss, patriarchy, and struggle. There, in fact, is no contradiction. Language can be loss, but to be recoverable implies hierarchy— to be recoverable implies that I’ll eventually be satisfied. A people is embodied within the voice, not the language.
