In previous years, Discover hosted a conference featuring a series of unscripted conversations between professors from each of the campuses. Wanting to subvert traditionally merit-based conferences, <em>nth degree: unconference</em> was a participatory space for students and faculty to reflect upon our educational experiences through workshops, intimate activities, and playful settings. <br><br>Despite RISD and Brown’s unique access to cross-campus resources, rigorous course loads, isolation within our majors, and bureaucratic barriers often make it difficult to take advantage of resources and communities that we are a part of. Over the day-long event, we found ourselves critiquing university rituals such as crit, a collaborative feedback process ubiquitous to art and design schools, reflecting on the ways in which we value our work in relation to ourselves, imagining what spaces we would like to see on campus, and learning what it means to be cared for within a classroom setting. <em>nth degree: unconference</em> was a reminder of our ability to find and build community as an act of collective care and defiance. <br><br>Thank you Kay Liang, Michael Caplan, and Libby Hays for such a formative experience and making me apart of the Conference Team.",

But every so often other Koreans will come in, firstly identifiable by language, but secondly identifiable by their twitching ears and widening eyes locating the startling sound of a familiar language in a Taiwanese-American business. A familar face. Their eyes interrogate mine. But who would their validation reveal beneath this fragile act? <br><br>If not yet comfirmed, the receipt name on their order often reveals the thin thread that connects us. The receipt in my hand softly trembles. While methodically making their drink, with each pour, sitr, and shake, I silently practice the pronunciation of their name. Their drink seals. So this is stage fright. <em>What did I just say? How did you just pronounce their name? How could it have sounded so right, but stumbled out of my mouth so wrong? What are they thinking?

Food is shared and gifted as an expressive, communicative act of hostpitality, respect, and love. Despite food being a language of care in many cultures, the commidification of food under late-stage capitalism perpuetuates our isolation from each other and our food. How can we value our food without understanding its origins, labor, and lifecycle? How can we share food when it isn’t treated as a basic necessity? <br><br>In the US, <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/facts\">millions of people struggle with poverty, low income and other finiancial burdens</a>, which is inextricably linked to food insecurity. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/americans-waste-food-fruit-vegetables-study\">150,000 tons of food is wasted by Americans each day</a>, the majority of which is wasted by those who can afford healthier diets. As a result, <a href=\"https://drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste\">food waste is also the world’s third largest emmitter of greenhouse gases</a>. The contradictions are quite obvious. Food is increasingly over-consumed, yet inaccessible, while at the same time, we are increasingly isolated from one another, yet need connection. Can we find that connection through food? <br><br>From a small pool of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxjbzdNtRD_FnPZzGtN03suQl_kcH8OGQc26wM-FAMs/edit?usp=sharing\">people we interviewed</a> in Providence, RI, sharing food was a complicated matter. There were many concerns regarding trust, convienence, willingness, and complacency, but from the food sharing experiences people have had, they derived from trusting relationships and communities, and/or prevention of food waste. Inspired by these types of gatherings and exchanges, we created a food sharing platform, <em>Sum</em>, that addresses these rising issues by providing a space to organize a shared meal with family, neighbors, and maybe some new friends. <br><br><div class=\"pageUpdate\"><em>Update 4/10/22: While this project furthers community connection and food consumption awareness, it does reinforce wealth disparities and does not necessarily increase food accessiblity as it is an experience that can only be afforded by some.

As a project that was begun in the spring semester of 2020, early within the COVID-19 pandemic, our group noticed a lack of digital tools for critical thinking and wandering thoughts as the world abruptly transitioned from physical to digital spaces. It was particularly apparent that this was also a reflection of our industrial-age education as it is a system that incentivizes efficiency and prescribed thought rather than creativity and curiosity. <br><br>For the duration of this project, we found open-ended, unstructured conversation to be conducive to the creativity and curiosity of thoughts. However, the ability to record, connect, and reflect is essential to even more profound ideas, questions and conversations. In many ways, the simple method of using post-it notes would have achieved our goals, but would not have been as responsive, engaging, and robust as we wanted. With this in mind, we used the analogy of galaxies to create a visualization and collection process which builds complexity and curiosity within one’s thoughts. <br><br><div class=\"pageUpdate\"><em>Update 4/7/21: There is always a new note-taking system being made, but it was really cool to find out that <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> was also being created at the same time as our porject in the spring of 2020.

My third attempt was the closest to conveying the experiences in which my work is grounded in, but I caught myself trying to forcibly wax poetics and meaning into it. I usually stop writing at that realization, but in the end, something else made sense in my closing thoughts. That a people is embodied within the voice, not the language. <br><br>In my third iteration, I said, “To lose a language means it is something recoverable. But to lose a language means to grieve it as well”. It is a contradiction that has defined my grief, as language, as Korean, feels intrinsically tied to a people, to an ancestry, to a history, to a sense of collective grief yet resiliency— to my 어머니. Sometimes I can feel exiled by language, unable to communicate with myself and other Koreans. But at the same time, transnational adoption and I originate from the same painful history of colonization, war, separation, loss, patriarchy, and capitalism. There, in fact, is no contradiction. Language can be loss, but to be recoverable implies hierarchy— to be recoverable implies that I’ll eventually be satisfied. A people is embodied within the voice, not the language.

Using the navigation tool the left, the buttons could be filtered and, like footnotes, their contents revealed. <br><br>In my website’s current form, I wanted to make navigation easier, while not losing the interaction of the numbered buttons, considering that not everyone has the time or want to explore its contents.",

Your hands create an enclosure to suggest permanence. Were you too withholding information from me? Withholding our impermanence to give false reassurance despite the flash of the camera being so blinding. Or would the pain within your eyes have been even more searing had I felt your arms slipping away?",

        "description": "Name journaling was a method I created for myself to document the transition between names as a Korean adoptee and the patterns based upon the instances each of the names that I am referred by was used. In 2021, I created a <a href=\"https://name-journal.glitch.me/\">website</a> to begin this documentation. Unfortunately, I was impatient with the idea, and had difficulty making a habit of journalling, thus I did not continue it. <br><br>A year later, I am still reminded of the significance of my names. The space between Trent          Lowe grows, as the space between Trent   Kim shrinks. Kangseok Kim (김강석) no longer only lives in my fabricated memories, and Trent Konglishized (트랜트) echoes uncomfortably in my ears. My original decision to reclaim my surname, rather than go by my adoptive name, Trent Lowe, was motivated by the cognitive dissonance I would feel knowing my name contradicted my face and embodied experiences. As I have begun name journaling again as of June 2022, I have been questioning the ways that adoptive names, or renaming, can reflect loss and the neo-colonial ethic inherent to transnational adoption. Now, when I name journal, I think of the crucial memories of each name knowing the significance is not recognized at the sound of my name. <br><br>Work in progress.",
