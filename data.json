In previous years, Discover hosted a conference featuring a series of unscripted conversations between professors from each of the campuses. Wanting to subvert traditionally merit-based conferences, <em>nth degree: unconference</em> was a participatory space for students and faculty to reflect upon our educational experiences through workshops, intimate activities, and playful settings. <br><br>Despite RISD and Brown’s unique access to cross-campus resources, rigorous course loads, isolation within our majors, and bureaucratic barriers often make it difficult to take advantage of resources and communities that we are a part of. Over the day-long event, we found ourselves critiquing university rituals such as crit, a collaborative feedback process ubiquitous to art and design schools, reflecting on the ways in which we value our work in relation to ourselves, imagining what spaces we would like to see on campus, and learning what it means to be cared for within a classroom setting. <em>nth degree: unconference</em> was a reminder of our ability to find and build community as an act of collective care and defiance. <br><br>Thank you Kay Liang, Michael Caplan, and Libby Hays for such a formative experience and making me apart of the team.",

The music reflects my taste, while helping with language learning, but I sense it’s ulterior purpose is identity validation. Choosing music to represent myself and the shop can feel like a performance. To be Korean can feel like a performance. <br><br>Thinking that many customers may associate the music with me being Korean, provides a duality of validation, yet anonymity I had never previously experienced. But every so often other Koreans will come in, firstly identifiable by language, but secondly identifiable by their twitching ears and widened eyes locating the startling sound of a familiar language in a Taiwanese-American business. Having features of a Korean person, their eyes interrogate mine to determine whether there is a shared identity, but their validation would reveal the person beneath this deceptive character. <br><br>Our shared identity is often confirmed by their receipt name from the order kiosk. My existance trembles all the way through the receipt in my hand. While methodically making their drink, with each pour, sitr, and shake, I silently practice the pronunciation of their name. As their drink seals, panic constrains me. <em>What did I just say? How did you just pronounce their name? How could it have sounded so right, but stumbled out of my mouth so wrong? What are they thinking? Did they smirk? Did they chuckle? What do they think? I’m a romanticizing “Koreaboo”?

Something comforting for the night. Something warm for the stomach. Food is shared and gifted as an expressive, communicative act of hostpitality, respect, and love. Despite food being a language of care in many cultures, the commidification of food under late-stage capitalism perpuetuates our isolation from each other and our food. How can we value our food without understanding its origins, labor, and lifecycle? How can we share food when it isn’t treated as a basic necessity? <br><br>In the US, <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/facts\">millions of people struggle with poverty, low income and other finiancial burdens</a>, which is inextricably linked to food insecurity. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/americans-waste-food-fruit-vegetables-study\">150,000 tons of food is wasted by Americans each day</a>, the majority of which is wasted by those who can afford healthier diets. As a result, <a href=\"https://drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste\">food waste is also the world’s third largest emmitter of greenhouse gases</a>. The contradictions are quite obvious. Food is increasingly over-consumed, yet inaccessible, while at the same time, we are increasingly isolated from one another, yet need connection. Can we find that connection through food? <br><br>From a small pool of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxjbzdNtRD_FnPZzGtN03suQl_kcH8OGQc26wM-FAMs/edit?usp=sharing\">people we interviewed</a> in Providence, RI, sharing food was a complicated matter. There were many concerns regarding trust, convienence, willingness, and complacency, but from the food sharing experiences people have had, they derived from trusting relationships and communities, and/or prevention of food waste. Inspired by these types of gatherings and exchanges, we created a food sharing platform, Sum, that addresses these rising issues by providing a space to organize a shared meal with family, neighbors, and maybe some new friends. <br><br>In collaboration with Yilan Sun.",
